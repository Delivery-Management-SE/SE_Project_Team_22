Implement Chat Functionality: Use WebSocket or a real-time communication library like Socket.IO in Node.js to facilitate real-time messaging.
Database Setup: Store messages, chat sessions, and user status information from mangoDB.
Integration with LLM and RAG:
Use API services like OpenAI for LLM (e.g., GPT-4) and a RAG model or create a custom RAG setup by combining a document retrieval system with GPT.
Ensure the chatbot can query the LLM/RAG to generate responses based on the chat context and retrieved external information relevant to the delivery management domain.

Retrieval Setup: For RAG, set up a retrieval system to fetch relevant data (like order details, delivery status, FAQs) from your database or external sources.
Message Handling: On receiving a chat message that requires a response from the chatbot (e.g., a query from the customer), the backend should:
Use the retrieval system to find relevant context or data.
Pass the query and retrieved context to the LLM/RAG to generate a response.
Send the generated response back through the real-time communication channel to display in the chat interface.
