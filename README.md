DeliverEase : dynamic delivery management platform, providing streamlined shipping solutions.

Architecture 
Frontend: Utilizes React.js for dynamic interfaces, with a focus on modular, reusable components and state management for responsive user experiences.
Backend Service(s): Comprises Node.js and Express.js-based microservices, each handling distinct business logic and communicating via RESTful APIs or message brokers.
Database(s): Leverages MongoDB for its flexible, document-oriented approach, facilitating scalable data management and agile development.
Microservices: Designed for autonomy with dedicated databases, service discovery, and load balancing to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

Architecture Style: Hybrid, blending event-driven and request-response paradigms. Optimizes asynchronous operations (event-driven) and provides immediate operations feedback (request-response).
Design Choice: Microservices architecture. Allows flexible, independent scaling and maintenance of services.
Decoupling vs. Reuse: Favors decoupling for service autonomy and maintenance ease.
